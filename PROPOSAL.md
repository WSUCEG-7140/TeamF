# Project Proposal

## Team Information

### Team Members:
<ul><li>Brian Davis - davis.443@wright.edu</li>

## Project Idea
The concept of our project will be an airline control system. The control system will manage the information for each flight (arrival time, departure time, flight status, origin, destination, type of plane, number of seats filled, how many of each type of seat, departure gate at origin, arrival gate at destination), the contact information for each passenger, what flight(s) the passenger is connected to (with seat information), and bag information (the passenger that the bag is connected to, origin/destination, weight).
<br><br>
This can be modeled using the MVC pattern as a database to store the information, a server controller to access the database, and a front-end application to interact with the server controller.
<br><br>
